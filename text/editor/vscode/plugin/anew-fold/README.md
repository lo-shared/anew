# Anew Fold README

none of the auto folding extension had worked properly for me, so I created my own. Sometimes you restart your IDE multiple times and you don't wanna lose the unfolded content. This extension preserves that, as well as it only fold or unfold newly opened files when you move your cursors around the folded text.

Settings and more stuff to come. Stay tuned for v2.

Enjoy!
